# Expo Camera: Null or Undefined cameraRef

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features (like `takePictureAsync`) before the camera has finished initializing. This results in `cameraRef.current` being `null` or `undefined`.

## Problem

The `cameraRef` object, used to interact with the camera, might not be ready immediately.  Accessing its methods before it's initialized causes errors.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous operations and checking if `cameraRef.current` is defined before attempting to use it.  The provided example uses React's `useEffect` hook and the camera's `onCameraReady` callback for proper synchronization.
