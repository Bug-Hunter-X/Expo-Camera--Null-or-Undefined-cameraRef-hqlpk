This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and trying to access the camera's features before the camera has been properly initialized.  This often manifests as a `null` or `undefined` value for `cameraRef`.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({ ... });
  }
};
```

The problem is that `cameraRef.current` might be null during initial render or before the camera is ready.
